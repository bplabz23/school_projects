# Documentation 



This folder contains two items:

1) Project Code - A pdf version of all source code put together.
2) Documentation - A pdf that serves as both a lab report and technical manual of the programmable function generator.


More in-depth description of the programmable function generator can be found in the documentation pdf, as well as the README in the src directory.
