## ADA Language Demonstration

   The following files are for a project that demonstrates that I am capable of picking up a language in a very short span of time.
The programming language I learned for the assignment is ADA. Given a test driver and a basic interface that specifies what datatypes I will be using,
my job was to actually implement functions that perform operations on binary numbers. These functions are to be written in the ADA language. Operations
on binary numbers include addition, subtraction, initialization, reversal, and conversion to/from integers.



  Along the way, I learned about many different features of the ADA language, including the difference between functions and procedures, side-effects,
parameter types (in, out, and in-out parameters), explicit type bindings, generic libraries, iterating over subtypes, and overloading special characters 
such as "+" and "-".  In the end, I learned that ADA is a very unique language packed with very useful features. Due to lack of resources available, it can be
harder to learn. However, in my opinion, it is the best language I have ever used that enforces best programming practices. Where other languages' type safety is
a hinderance, ADA's type-binding is a help.
